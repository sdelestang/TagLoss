#'Double-mark (ab) data in wide format
#'
#'@details As part of a Department of Primary Industries and Regional Developement (DPIRD) research project over 2000 Western Rock Lobsters were double marked: One T-bar tag was inserted ventrally (see de Lestang et al., 2016 for details) and a month-specific pleopod was snipped from the animal (the snipped pleopod provides a semi-permanent mark which is re-snipped upon subsequent recaptures therefore extending its mark life indefinately).  Time of all recaptures and the presence or absense of tags when snipped pleopods were identified were  reported by DPIRD staff.  This data contains only the liberty time in months (column 1), and for each liberty time the number of lobsters recaptured with both marks (tag and snipped pleopod), only a snipped ploepod (column 2) and only a tag (column 3).
